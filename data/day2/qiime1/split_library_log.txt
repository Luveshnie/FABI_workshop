Number of sequences with identifiable barcode but without identifiable reverse primer: 1374

-z truncate_only option enabled; sequences without a discernible reverse primer as well as sequences with a valid barcode not found in the mapping file may still be written.

Sequence length details for all sequences passing quality filters:
Raw len min/max/avg	230.0/547.0/329.4
Wrote len min/max/avg	180.0/512.0/280.8

Barcodes corrected/not	0/115740
Uncorrected barcodes will not be written to the output fasta file.
Corrected barcodes will be written with the appropriate barcode category.
Corrected but unassigned sequences will not be written unless --retain_unassigned_reads is enabled.

Total valid barcodes that are not in mapping file	0
Sequences associated with valid barcodes that are not in the mapping file will not be written.
